# Modified-DES-Algorithm

CPSC 370 Modified DES project

### Description:
Involves using a 64 bit plaintext given in hexadecimal and a 64 bit key also in hexadecimal. This modified version of DES is a simplified version of the real algorithm. It was created to help give a good starting foundation on how the algorithm actually works. 

The only differences between the two algorithms are the S-boxes and the amount of rounds it goes through. This modified algorithm only has one S-box and it only goes through two rounds to produce the ciphertext from the given plaintext and key
